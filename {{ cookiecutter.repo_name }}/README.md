# ML Projects Readme Template

A simple and well designed structure is essential for any Machine Learning project, so we have designed a project template that combines **simplicity, best practice for folder structure** and **good OOP design** which could be easily scaled into any machine learning project.
The main idea is that there's much same stuff you do every time when you start your machine learning project, so wrapping all repetitive parts of documentation and delivery will help you to change just the core idea every time you start a new pytorch project. 

**So, here’s a simple template that help you get into your main project faster and just focus on your core (Model Architecture, Training Flow, etc)**

A few tips to keep in mind while using this template:
- You can remove everything above table of contents and populate project title and description if not done already.
- The current structure of readme is designed keeping in mind my past projects and my idea of ML projects. Hence, be flexible with content of readme. If a section doesn't make sense for your project, remove it. Likewise, if a section is missing from the template that you would think is necessary, add it.
- Try to not remove the "In a Nutshell", "Directory structure" "Contributing", "Acknowledgments" as these apply to all projects.

## Paper Title
This repository is the official implementation of [Paper Title](https://arxiv.org/abs/2030.12345). 

>📋  Optional: include a graphic explaining your approach/main result, bibtex entry, link to demos, blog posts and tutorials

tip: use this section to link a paper if there exists or there is going to be a paper written for this project.

## In a Nutshell   
> 📋  Use this section to give the audience a quick guide on setup instructions and running a version of your project.

Instructions could include things like:

- creating appropriate folders or filepaths

-- Example: In `modeling`  folder create a python file named whatever you like, here we named it `example_model.py` . In `modeling/__init__.py` file, you can build a function named `build_model` to call your model

- creating code blocks

Example: 
```python
from .example_model import ResNet18

def build_model(cfg):
    model = ResNet18(cfg.MODEL.NUM_CLASSES)
    return model
``` 

- instructions on how to install libraries and dependencies

>📋  This will be the actual file structure of your project which could look a bit different from the template directory structure

## Requirements
To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

>📋  Describe how to set up the environment, e.g. pip/conda/docker commands, download datasets, etc...

## Training
To train the model(s) in the paper, run this command:

```train
python train.py --input-data <path_to_data> --alpha 10 --beta 20
```

>📋  Describe how to train the models, with example commands on how to train the models in your paper, including the full training procedure and appropriate hyperparameters.

## Evaluation
To evaluate my model on example_dataset, run:

```eval
