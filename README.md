# ML Proejct template

_A logical, reasonably standardized, but flexible project structure for doing and sharing data science work._


### Requirements to use the cookiecutter template:
-----------
 - Python 2.7 or 3.5+
 - [Cookiecutter Python package](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html) >= 1.4.0: This can be installed with pip by or conda depending on how you manage your Python packages:

``` bash
$ pip install cookiecutter
```

or

``` bash
$ conda config --add channels conda-forge
$ conda install cookiecutter
```


### To start a new project, run:
------------

    cookiecutter [https://github.com/Deloitte/deloitte-visionai-project-template.git](https://github.com/M4sum/ml-project-template)

A similar video to the installation is shown below

#### Some Guidelines:
* The directory structure of your new project looks like this: 

* If details assked in CLI while installation are unnecessary for your project, hit Enter.

* This directory structure is a standard but flexible format for organizing your project. While creating your project if some folders or files are not necessary you may leave them as they are. However, we highly recommend you follow a structure llike this for making well- organizd deployable machine learning/ data-science projects.
